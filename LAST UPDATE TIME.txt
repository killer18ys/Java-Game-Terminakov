-Update date and time : 11/8/2015 ,15:37

-Updated by: Val

-Changes made: 

*Fixed the damage, now the player is taking proper damage\
*Added a fist marker to which one should aim to hit
*Made the fisst maker spawn at different locations randomly

TO DO:

Fist marker should be delayed at a seperate thread avoiding delaying the whole program

Damage should only be taken only when a fist marker is being hit
